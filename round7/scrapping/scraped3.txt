OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS)The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) is a set of generic attack detection rules for use with ModSecurity or compatible web application firewalls. The CRS aims to protect web applications from a wide range of attacks, including the OWASP Top Ten, with a minimum of false alerts.CRS ResourcesPlease see the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set page to get introduced to the CRS and view resources on installation, configuration, and working with the CRS.Contributing to the CRSWe strive to make the OWASP ModSecurity CRS accessible to a wide audience of beginner and experienced users. We are interested in hearing any bug reports, false positive alert reports, evasions, usability issues, and suggestions for new detections.Create an issue on GitHub to report a false positive or false negative (evasion). Please include your installed version and the relevant portions of your ModSecurity audit log.Sign up for the mailing list to ask general usage questions and participate in discussions on the CRS.Join the #modsecurity channel on Freenode IRC to chat about the CRS.

During the process you will learn the basics and will be able to take the skills to your own projects. You can read the book online.How to Use This Repository?The repository has been split in two main parts: manuscript and project_source. You can find the freely available chapters under manuscript organized per chapter. project_source contains source associated to each chapter.There is no single right way to approach the book. It depends on your experience level and interest. You can build the project from scratch by following the book or you can start from a specific stage. Just pick the source from previous chapter as your starting point.Please note that the repository defaults to the dev branch of the book. master contains the source of the most recent version. Each version has been tagged so that it's easy for you to find the source matching to the version of the book you are reading.Getting SupportAs no book is perfect, you will likely come by issues and might have some questions related to the content.

It is currently being used in several apps, with a combined total of almost 500k monthly active users. If you use BrightFutures in production, we'd love to hear about it!Latest newsBrightFutures 5.0 is now available! This update adds Swift 3 compatibility and contains breaking changes that are in line with the syntax changes between Swift 2 and 3. Please check the Migration guide for help on how to migrate your project to BrightFutures 5.0.There are plans beyond 5.0 to do a more thorough rewrite in which the approach on error handling will be reevaluated and the Swift 3 API naming guidelines are better applied.

You'll know this because it'll have an even major release number. We do not currently support unstable versions and while the module may happen to work on some unstable versions you'll find that we quickly close issues if you're not using a stable version.If you are on a stable version of node, we can't magically know what you are doing to expose an issue, it is best if you provide a snippet of code or log files if you're having an install issue. This snippet need not include your secret sauce, but it must replicate the issue you are describing. The issues that get closed without resolution tend to be the ones that don't help us help you.

Learning RxJava for Android by exampleThis is a repository with real-world useful examples of using RxJava with Android. It usually will be in a constant state of "Work in Progress" (WIP).I also gave a talk at a local meetup about warming up to RxJava here. Here's a link to the video and slides.Examples:Concurrency using schedulersA common requirement is to offload lengthy heavy I/O intensive operations to a background thread (non-UI thread) and feed the results back to the UI/main thread, on completion. This is a demo of how long-running operations can be offloaded to a background thread. After the operation is done, we resume back on the main thread. All using RxJava! Think of this as a replacement to AsyncTasks.The long operation is simulated by a blocking Thread.sleep call (since this is done in a background thread, our UI is never interrupted).To really see this example shine. Hit the button multiple times and see how the button click (which is a UI operation) is never blocked because the long operation only runs in the background.Accumulate calls (buffer)

-->JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm
ArchiSteamFarmASF is a C# application that allows you to farm steam cards using multiple steam accounts simultaneously. Unlike Idle Master which works only for one account at given time, requires steam client running in background, and launches additional processes imitiating "game playing" status, ASF doesn't require any steam client running in the background, doesn't launch any additional processes and is made to handle unlimited steam accounts at once. In addition to that, it's meant to be run on servers or other desktop-less machines, and features full Mono support, which makes it possible to launch on any Mono-supported operating system, such as Windows, Linux or OS X. ASF is based on, and possible, thanks to SteamKit2.ASF doesn't require and doesn't interfere in any way with Steam client. In addition to that, it no longer requires exclusive access to given account, which means that you can use your main account in Steam client, and use ASF for farming the same account at the same time. If you decide to launch a game, ASF will get disconnected, and resume farming once you finish playing your game, being as transparent as possible.Core featuresAutomatic farming of available games with card drops using any number of active accountsNo requirement of running or even having official Steam client installedGuarantee of being VAC-freeComplex error-reporting mechanism, allowing ASF to be smart and resume farming even in case of Steam or networking problemsCustomizable cards farming algorithm which will push performance of cards farming to the maximum
