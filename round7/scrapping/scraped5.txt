Thanks to SponsorsYourKit supports open source projects with its full-featured Java Profiler. YourKit, LLC is the creator of YourKit Java Profiler and YourKit .NET Profiler, innovative and intelligent tools for profiling Java and .NET applications.QuasarQuasar is an open source NoSQL analytics engine that can be used as a library or through a REST API to power advanced analytics across a growing range of data sources and databases, including MongoDB.SQL²SQL² is the dialect of SQL that Quasar understands.SQL² is a superset of standard SQL. Therefore, in the following documentation SQL² will be used interchangeably with SQL.See the SQL² tutorial for more info on SQL².SQL² supports variables inside queries (SELECT * WHERE pop < :cutoff). Values for these variables, which can be any expression, should be specified as additional parameters in the url, using the variable name prefixed by var. (e.g. var.cutoff=1000). Failure to specify valid values for all variables used inside a query will result in an error. These values use the same syntax as the query itself; notably, strings should be surrounded by double quotes. Some acceptable values are 123, "CO", and DATE("2015-07-06").

MAMEBuild status for tiny build only, containing just core parts of projectOS/CompilerStatusLinux GCC / OSX ClangWindows MinGWWhat is MAME?MAME originally stood for Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator.MAME's purpose is to preserve decades of software history. As electronic technology continues to rush forward, MAME prevents this important "vintage" software from being lost and forgotten. This is achieved by documenting the hardware and how it functions. The source code to MAME serves as this documentation. The fact that the software is usable serves primarily to validate the accuracy of the documentation (how else can you prove that you have recreated the hardware faithfully?). Over time, MAME absorbed the sister-project MESS (Multi Emulator Super System), so MAME now documents a wide variety of (mostly vintage) computers, video game consoles and calculators, in addition to the arcade video games that were its initial focus.

ContainerPilotAn application-centric micro-orchestrator that automates the process of service discovery, configuration, and lifecycle management inside the container, so you can focus on your apps.What is ContainerPilot?ContainerPilot is an application-centric micro-orchestrator that automates the process of service discovery, configuration, and lifecycle management inside the container.Orchestration is the automation of the operations of an application. Most application require operational tasks like connecting them to related components (WordPress needs to know where it's MySQL and Memcached servers are, for example), and some applications require special attention as they start up or shut down to be sure they bootstrap correctly or persist their data. We can do all that by hand, but modern applications automate those tasks in code. That's called "orchestration."To make this work, every application needs to do the following (at a minimum):Register itself in a service catalog (like Consul or Etcd) for use by other appsLook to the service catalog to find the apps it depends onConfigure itself when the container starts, and reconfigure itself over time
