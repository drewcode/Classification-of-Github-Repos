updateNov 2, 2016-->ITCoders/Human-detection-and-Tracking
Human detetion and TrackingIntroductionIn this project we have worked on the problem of human detection,face detection, face recognition and tracking an individual. Our project is capable of detecting a human and its face in a given video and storing Local Binary Pattern Histogram (LBPH) features of the detected faces.LBPH features are the key points extracted from an image which is used to recognize and categorize images. Once a human is detected in video, we have tracked that person assigning him a label. We have used the stored LBPH features of individuals to recognize them in any other videos. After scanning through various videos our program gives output like- person labeled as subject1 is seen in video taken by camera1, subject1 is seen in video by camera2. In this way we have tracked an individual by recognizing him/her in the video taken by multiple cameras. Our whole work is based on the application of machine learning and image processing with the help of openCV.This code is built on opencv 3.1.1 and python 3.4RequirementsopencvInstallation in linux:For complete installation of opencv in ubuntu you can refer here.Installation in windowsFor complete installation of opencv in windows you can refer here

-->jasonlong/isometric-contributions
This is an extension for Chrome, Safari (see note below), and Firefox (beta) that lets you toggle between your regular GitHub contribution chart and an isometric pixel art version. It uses obelisk.js for the isometric graphics.Besides being sort of neat looking, this view is interesting in that it highlights the differences between the number of contributions with more granularity. This isn't meant to completely replace the standard 2D graph though, because in most ways it is actually less useful. For example, there are no axis labels, shorter bars can be hidden behind taller ones, you can't hover over a bar to see the day and count, etc.InstallationNOTE: When installing this extension, you will likely see a warning about it needing access to all domains, not just github.com. This is required for people who are using GitHub Enterprise since it can be installed on any domain name.ChromeThe easiest way to install the extension is through the Chrome Web Store:https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/isometric-contributions/mjoedlfflcchnleknnceiplgaeoegien?hl=en&gl=USFirefoxOnly Firefox Developer Edition is supported at the moment. Set xpinstall.signatures.required to false in about:config. Download the isometric-contributions.xpi file and open it in Firefox Developer Edition. Or, in Add-ons Manager, choose "Install Add-on From File" under the wrench icon and choose the xpi file you downloaded.
