node-ffiNode.js Foreign Function Interfacenode-ffi is a Node.js addon for loading and calling dynamic libraries usingpure JavaScript. It can be used to create bindings to native libraries withoutwriting any C++ code.It also simplifies the augmentation of node.js with C code as it takes care ofhandling the translation of types across JavaScript and C, which can add reamsof boilerplate code to your otherwise simple C. See the example/factorialfor an example of this use case.

WKZombieWKZombie is an iOS/OSX web-browser without a graphical user interface. It was developed as an experiment in order to familiarize myself with using functional concepts written in Swift 3 (Swift 2.2 for versions < 1.0).It incorporates WebKit (WKWebView) for rendering and hpple (libxml2) for parsing the HTML content. In addition, it can take snapshots and has rudimentary support for parsing/decoding JSON elements. Chaining asynchronous actions makes the code compact and easy to use.Use CasesThere are many use cases for a Headless Browser.

Red Programming LanguageRed is a new programming language strongly inspired by Rebol, but with a broader field of usage thanks to its native-code compiler, from system programming to high-level scripting, while providing modern support for concurrency and multi-core CPUs.Red has its own complete cross-platform toolchain, featuring two compilers, an interpreter and a linker, not depending on any third-party library, except for a Rebol2 interpreter, required during the bootstrap phase. Once complete, Red will be self-hosted.The Red software stack also contains another language, Red/System, which is a low-level dialect of Red. It is a limited C-level language with a Red look'n feel, required to build Red's runtime library and be the target language of Red's compiler.

Covered topics include special functions, linear algebra, probability models, random numbers, statistics, interpolation, integration, regression, curve fitting, integral transforms (FFT) and more.In addition to the core .NET package (which is written entirely in C#), Numerics specifically supports F# with idiomatic extension modules and maintains mathematical data structures like BigRational that originated in the F# PowerPack. If a performance boost is needed, the managed-code provider backing its linear algebra routines and decompositions can be exchanged with wrappers for optimized native implementations such as Intel MKL.Math.NET Numerics is covered under the terms of the MIT/X11 license.

Here is a link to the promo video:Our plan is to add more packages that help users understand and interact meaningfully with machine learning.Lime is able to explain any black box text classifier, with two or more classes.
