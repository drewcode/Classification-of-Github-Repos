-->Xeroday/Spotify-Ad-Blocker
EZBlockerEZBlocker is a Spotify Ad Blocker written in C# for Windows 7/8/10.It uses non-intrusive methods to read the Spotify client to extract song information. When an advertisement is playing, EZBlocker will mute Spotify and automatically resume playing regular music when the ad is over.Because EZBlocker does not modify the Spotify client in any way, it is less buggy compared to other ad blockers. The goal for EZBlocker is to be the most reliable and stable ad blocker for Spotify.For more info, visit the EZBlocker project page.To download a pre-compiled binary of the latest version, click here.Changelog (Major releases only):V 1.6 (March 10, 2016):Better handling of Spotify updates/restarts

-->verlok/lazyload
LazyLoad (aka Vanilla LazyLoad)LazyLoad is a fast, lightweight and flexible script for loading images only when they're about to enter the viewport of a scrollable area, which supports the srcset attribute and with and takes best advantage from the progressive JPEG image format (which is good for performance).WEBSITE | DEMOS | GITHUBDifference with jQuery_lazyloadThis script was inspired by Mika Tuupola's jQuery_lazyLoad.The following are the main differences between the scripts.LazyLoad is 6x faster than jQuery_lazyload. This is because LazyLoad uses only optimized, native javascript functions and methods, and not jQuery. Your users will see the difference, even in slow devices or computers. To measure the scripts performance yourself, see lazyLoad and jQuery_lazyLoad implementations in the perf folder.Progressive JPEG support will improve perceived speed. Progressive JPEG is an image format good for perceived performance because it's rendered in progressive passes of detail. lazyLoad has an option called show_while_loading that, when set to true, shows your images while they load, letting progressive JPEG do its magic. As jQuery_lazyload doesn't have this option, it will only show your images once fully loaded.LazyLoad can be instanced on many scrolling containers on the same page, whereas jQuery_lazyload can't.

-->tonsky/rum
Rum is a client/server library for HTML UI. In ClojureScript, it works as React wrapper, in Clojure, it is a static HTML generator.PrinciplesSimple semantics: Rum is arguably smaller, simpler and more straightforward than React itself.Decomplected: Rum is a library, not a framework. Use only the parts you need, throw away or replace what you don’t need, combine different approaches in a single app, or even combine Rum with other frameworks.No enforced state model: Unlike Om, Reagent or Quiescent, Rum does not dictate where to keep your state. Instead, it works well with any storage: persistent data structures, atoms, DataScript, JavaScript objects, localStorage or any custom solution you can think of.Extensible: the API is stable and explicitly defined, including the API between Rum internals. It lets you build custom behaviours that change components in significant ways.Minimal codebase: You can become a Rum expert just by reading its source code (~900 lines).Comparison to other frameworksRum:

Mosaico - Responsive Email Template EditorMosaico is a JavaScript library (or maybe a single page application) supporting the editing of email templates.The great thing is that Mosaico itself does not define what you can edit or what styles you can change: this is defined by the template. This makes Mosaico very flexible.At this time we provide a single template to illustrate some best practice examples: more templates will come soon! Please get in touch with us if you want to make your email html template "Mosaico ready".Live demoOn https://mosaico.io you can see a live demo of Mosaico: the live deploy has a custom backend (you don't see it) and some customization (custom Moxiemanager integration, customized onboarding slideshow, contextual menu, and some other small bits), but 95% of what you see is provided by this library. You will also see a second working template there: we are still working to open source it.

-->TomorrowTodayLabs/NewtonVR
SummaryGo to newtonvr.readme.io for documentation, guides on how to get started with NewtonVR, and basic integration instructions.Our system allows players to pick up, drop, throw, and use held objects. Items don't pass through other items (rigidbodies), or the environment (non-rigidbodies). Rather, held items interact with other rigidbodies naturally -- taking mass into account. For example, if you have two boxes of the same mass they can push each other equally, but a balloon, with considerably less mass, can't push a box.For more information on this style of mass-based interaction, see this article by Nick Abel, one of the creators of NewtonVR.Items can be configured to be picked up at any point, or when grabbed, can rotate and position themselves to match a predefined orientation. This lets you pick up a box from its corner as well as pick up a gun and have it orient to the grip.We've also created a few physical UI elements to help with basic configuration and "menu type scenarios. We also give you the option to dynamically let the controllers turn into physical objects on a button press.NewtonVR brought to you by Tomorrow Today Labs:Development: Keith Bradner, Nick AbelInteraction Design: Adrienne HunterModeling: Wesley Eldridge, Carli WoodAudio: Joshua Du CheneContact GitHub

Please keep in mind that this started as a journal and so I have kept the code as it was when I solved the original challenges. This means that I did not re-write them with more advance techniques or improved on them but instead leave them as is until the problems are updated and they need thus the solution needs to be updated too.If you are also part of the camp or would like to contribute in any way then feel free to contact me. The purpose of this is for reference and learning material overall, for everyone as it is public. If you encounter a solution that no longer works then please open an issue so that I can work on it. While I do not accept solutions from other people for this repo, feel free to send pull request with fixes to typos or better explanations and examples. Shortly after I started this wiki, I became part of FreeCodeCamp and manage the wiki there, so if you want updated solutions with more advance solutions you will find them there instead.If you find this useful then follow and start it, feel free to share it also.If you want to contribute to the repo in general with fixes such as typos, better explanations or anything other than replacing my code solutions then follow this guide.

The PenTesters Framework (PTF)A TrustedSec Project - Copyright 2016Written by: David Kennedy (@HackingDave)https://www.trustedsec.comTwitter: @TrustedSec, @HackingDaveThe PenTesters Framework (PTF) is a Python script designed for Debian/Ubuntu/ArchLinux based distributions to create a similar and familiar distribution for Penetration Testing. As pentesters, we've been accustom to the /pentest/ directories or our own toolsets that we want to keep up-to-date all of the time. We have those "go to" tools that we use on a regular basis, and using the latest and greatest is important.PTF attempts to install all of your penetration testing tools (latest and greatest), compile them, build them, and make it so that you can install/update your distribution on any machine. Everything is organized in a fashion that is cohesive to the Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) and eliminates a lot of things that are hardly used. PTF simplifies installation and packaging and creates an entire pentest framework for you. Since this is a framework, you can configure and add as you see fit. We commonly see internally developed repos that you can use as well as part of this framework. It's all up to you.The ultimate goal is for community support on this project. We want new tools added to the github repository. Submit your modules. It's super simple to configure and add them and only takes a few minute.Instructions:

Open Network Insight The business of network security - the "port perspective"Open Network Insight is open source software for leveraging insights from flow and packet analysis. It helps enterprises and service providers gain insight on their compute environments through transparency of service delivery and identification of potential security threats or attacks happening among resources operating at cloud scale.While current threat intelligence tools help, identifying unknown threats and attacks remains a challenge. Open Network Insight provides tools to accelerate companies’ ability to expose suspicious connections and previously unseen attacks using flow and packet analysis technologies.OverviewWith the arrival of big data platforms, security organizations can now make data-driven decisions about how they protect their assets.Records of network traffic, captured as network flows, are often stored and analyzed for use in network management.An organization can use this same information to gain insight into what channels corporate information flows through.By taking into account additional context such as prevalent attacks and key protocols to the organization, the security team can develop a strategy that applies the right amount of per-channel risk mitigation based on the value of the data flowing through it.For an organization, we call this “the port perspective”.

-->onevcat/APNGKit
APNGKit is a high performance framework for loading and displaying APNG images in iOS. It's built on top of a modified version of libpng with APNG support and written in Swift. High-level abstractions of Cocoa Touch is used for a delightful API. Since be that, you will feel at home and joy when using APNGKit to play with images in APNG format.APNG, what and why?The Animated Portable Network Graphics (APNG) is a file format extending the well-known PNG format. It allows for animated PNG files that work similarly to animated GIF files, while supporting 24-bit images and 8-bit transparency not available for GIFs. This means much better quality of animation. At the same time, the file size is comparable to or even less than, if created carefully, GIFs.Talk is cheap; show me the image. You can click on the image to see how it looks like when animating.That's cool. APNG is much better! But wait...why haven't I heard about APNG before? It is not a popular format, so why should I use it in my next great iOS app?Good question! APNG is an excellent extension for regular PNG, and it is also very simple to use and not conflicting with current PNG standard (It consists a standard PNG header, so if your platform does not support APNG, it will be recognized as a normal PNG with its first frame being displayed as a static image). But unfortunately, it is a rebel format so that it is not accepted by the PNG group. However, it is accepted by many vendors and is even mentioned in W3C Standards. There is another format called MNG (Multiple-image Network Graphics), which is created by the same team as PNG. It is a comprehensive format, but very very very (重要的事要说三遍) complex. It is so complex that despite being a "standard", it was almost universally rejected. There is only one "popular" browser called Konqueror(at least I have used it before when I was in high school) that supports MNG, which is really a sad but reasonable story.Even though APNG is not accepted currently, we continue to see the widespread implementation of it. Apple recently supported APNG in both desktop and mobile Safari. Microsoft Edge and Chrome are also considering adding APNG support since it is already officially added in WebKit core.APNG is such a nice format to bring users much better experience of animating images. The more APNG is used, the more recognition and support it will get. Not only in the browsers world, but also in the apps we always love. That's why I created this framework.Installation

-->olipo186/Git-Auto-Deploy
What is it?Git-Auto-Deploy consists of a small HTTP server that listens for Web hook requests sent from GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket servers. This application allows you to continuously and automatically deploy you projects each time you push new commits to your repository.How does it work?When commits are pushed to your Git repository, the Git server will notify Git-Auto-Deploy by sending a HTTP POST request with a JSON body to a pre configured URL (your-host:8001). The JSON body contains detailed information about the repository and what event that triggered the request. Git-Auto-Deploy parses and validates the request, and if all goes well it issues a git pull.Additionally, Git-Auto-Deploy can be configured to execute a shell command upon each successful git pull, which can be used to trigger custom build actions or test scripts.Getting startedYou can install Git-Auto-Deploy in multiple ways. Below are instructions for the most common methods.Install from PPA (recommended for debian systems)Add our PPA repository.

PurposeCountryPicker is a custom UIPickerView subclass that provides an iOS control allowing a user to select a country from a list. It can optionally display a flag next to each country name, and the library includes a set of 249 public domain flag images from https://github.com/koppi/iso-country-flags-svg-collection that have been renamed to work with the library.Note that the list of countries is based on the ISO 3166 country code standard (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1). This list excludes certain smaller countries, regarding them as part of a larger state. For example, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are lumped together as Great Britain. For most purposes this is fine as it matches the convention used for locales, but if you need to specify additional countries, you can subclass and modify the countires list as described under "Subclassing" below.Supported iOS & SDK VersionsSupported build target - iOS 10.0 (Xcode 8.0, Apple LLVM compiler 8.0)Earliest supported deployment target - iOS 6.0Earliest compatible deployment target - iOS 5.0NOTE: 'Supported' means that the library has been tested with this version. 'Compatible' means that the library should work on this iOS version (i.e. it doesn't rely on any unavailable SDK features) but is no longer being tested for compatibility and may require tweaking or bug fixes to run correctly.ARC Compatibility
